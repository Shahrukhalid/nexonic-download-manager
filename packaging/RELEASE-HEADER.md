# Nexonic Download Manager 0.21.0

**Keep downloads on your VPN.** Windows and Linux: Options → Connection → Network adapter keeps every download, video and torrent on one adapter and stops them if it disconnects. Torrents can also use a blocklist, and Google Drive, Dropbox and GitHub share links download the file itself. Includes 0.20.x (15 languages, live language switch).

**Mac, first launch:** macOS says it *could not verify* the app because it's free and not sold through Apple. Click **Done**, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, click **Open Anyway**, then **Open Anyway** again and enter your Mac password. Only once; updates installed with **Update Now** open without a warning. [Pictures of each step](https://github.com/Shahrukhalid/nexonic-download-manager#first-launch-on-mac)

**Windows:** if SmartScreen appears, click **More info → Run anyway**. [Code signing policy](https://github.com/Shahrukhalid/nexonic-download-manager/blob/main/docs/CODE-SIGNING.md)

**Android:** open `NexonicDownloadManager-Android.apk` on your phone and allow installing from your browser or Files app when asked. Older 32-bit phones: `NexonicDownloadManager-Android-32bit.apk`.

**Linux:** `NexonicDownloadManager-Linux-x86_64.AppImage` runs on every distribution (`chmod +x`, then open it); ARM computers: `-aarch64.AppImage`. Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Pop!_OS: the `.deb`. Fedora, openSUSE: the `.rpm`. Check files with `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS-linux-x64.txt`.

**Torrents:** torrents use your proxy setting (No proxy, HTTP, SOCKS5 or the system's proxy) and the speed limit for all downloads; DNS over HTTPS is not used for torrents. Peers and trackers can see your IP address (or your proxy's). [Torrent guide](https://github.com/Shahrukhalid/nexonic-download-manager/blob/main/docs/TORRENTS.md)
